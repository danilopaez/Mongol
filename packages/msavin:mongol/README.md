==================

Meet Mongol, the insanely handy development package for Meteor. Starting today, you'll never have to enter the console to play with your collections again. Get started with: 

	meteor add msavin:mongol

After installation, simply press <strong>Control + M</strong> to toggle it.


Your Documents, At a Glance
----------------------------
Mongol will automatically detect your collections and display your client-side documents. You can always see how many documents you are subscribing to, and browsing them is just a click away.

Easily View & Modify Documents
------------------------------
Mongol is able to insert, update and/or remove any document in your database, regardless if you have `insecure` or the permissions to allow it. Read the <a href="https://github.com/msavin/Mongol/blob/master/SECURITY.md">security</a> post to learn how this works.

Only There When You Want It
